# Regional Compilation

Regional compilation applies `torch.compile` to the repeated transformer blocks
declared by a diffusion model. It is the default compilation scope when
diffusion inference runs without `--enforce-eager`.

## Configuration

Dynamic compilation is enabled by default so the compiled regions can handle
mixed resolutions. For a fixed-shape workload, disable it explicitly:

```bash
vllm serve <model> --omni --no-diffusion-compile-dynamic
```

The equivalent per-stage deploy configuration is:

```yaml
stages:
  - stage_id: 0
    diffusion_compile_granularity: regional
    diffusion_compile_dynamic: false
```

For an experimental whole-transformer compile scope, set
`--diffusion-compile-granularity full` or use
`diffusion_compile_granularity: full` in the stage configuration. Full scope may
still contain graph breaks; it does not force one graph. It is rejected when
HSDP, sequence parallelism, CPU offload, or layerwise offload is enabled. Use
regional scope with those features.

These settings control the generic model-runner compilation path. Pipelines
that provide their own `setup_compile()` implementation manage their compilation
policy independently. Compilation is lazy, so backend or graph errors can first
surface on the initial request.

Use `--enforce-eager` to disable the model runner's generic compile setup.
Pipelines that compile internally define their own eager-mode behavior.
